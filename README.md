# nightingale
A very simple template page using google's exelent material components.
It is an experimental project made to practice web technologies and webdesign.

Just point your browser to [this site](https://aerobird98.github.io/nightingale/)!

It suposed to be a template and nothing more, in the future I want to use this template as
a foundation for my own websites using material design.
