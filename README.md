# Nightingale
A **very simple** template page using google's _material components_.
It is an experimental project made to practice web technologies and webdesign.

It suposed to be a template and nothing more, in the future I want to use this template as
a foundation for my own websites using material design.

# TODO list

* integrate jekyll
* add mdc modal drawer
* more to come...
